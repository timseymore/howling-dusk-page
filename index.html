                    <p>Howling Dusk is a single-player first-person survival game set in a large open-world island wilderness environment
                         where the player must maintain vitals such as hunger and thirst while avoiding attacks by predators, extreme weather, and disease.
                          It will blend emotional experiences from a peaceful almost meditative natural setting to moments of suspense and fear.
                           The game is targeted at teen to mature, casual or hardcore survival game players on a PC platform.  </p>
                    <p>The player starts the game in one of two possible scenarios. There will be a shipwreck survivor and a plane crash survivor scenario
                         for the player to choose from. The shipwreck will start the player on the beach with plenty of distance before encountering any predators.
                          The plane crash will start deeper in the island near a mountain, much closer to threats of extreme conditions and predators.
                          This will give the player an extra option for difficulty and added replay value.</p>
                    <p>The wildlife will be huntable for meat and hide, amount being relative to animal size.
                         The animals found in the game will be frogs, snakes, rabbits, wild boar, deer, wolves, and bears.
                          The predators are the snakes, wolves, and bears. The main threat being packs of wolves stalking the player at night.
                           Best build a good defense at camp. However, a buck or wild boar may defend itself if attacked as well.
                             The meat can be cooked for food or eaten raw if you want to risk food poisoning. There will also be wild berries to be picked,
                              but not all species are as safe to eat as others. Water can be found in lakes and streams, though boiling it before drinking
                               would avoid dysentery. The hide found from animals can be crafted into clothing. Plant fibers, rocks, and sticks can be harvested
                                from the environment.
                         These will be the basic items needed to make buildable items in the game.</p>
                    <p>The player will start with a basic tutorial mission line to get started.  The final mission will be for the player to find a cabin located
                         near the center of the island, the most dangerous area, that will contain an old flare gun which may be used to signal for help.
                           The game will end with the player being saved.
                          The player may choose to ignore this and play their game and build indefinitely with respawning resources. </p>
